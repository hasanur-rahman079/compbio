wiggling and jiggling
omics vs MD
omics = have the data from clinical observation
Molecular dynamics simulation for all

predict themodynamics quantities
from micro to micro
therodynamics partition function

process: experimental plans
fentoseconds
Force fields
AMBER, GROMACS and CHARMM
NAMD HOOMD, LAMMPS
MD engine

structure revealed from NMR and Crystal
Protonation: charging the proteins
Disulfide : cystin 
Phosphorylation

.dcd = is the important file	
.crd = coordinates
.psf = which attoms are connected || bonding

Ans:
1. bleow 1 A the hydrogen structure are blind
2. water A 15 (at least 10)
3. Alphafold



Q&A:
1. RCSB PDB parameters
2. How do i can trust the mideling
3. energy confirmations

#Steps to write the script

slarms
=====
#step-1: shebang initiate

bindin#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J ondemand/sys/myjobs/day-1files (specify the job name)
#SBATCH --nodes=1 (number of nodes and cores we want to use)
#SBATCH --time=00:12:00 (the times we want to run the job)
#SBATCH --exclusive (means, you dont want to access anyone in this node)
#SBATCH --account=PGS0299 (our project account to pay the job credits ðŸ˜›)

#step-2 (setting NAMD environemnt by loading modules, run module available in shell to see available modules)
module load intel/19.0.5
module load mvapich2/2.3.4
module load namd/2.13

#step-3 (commands to run)
run_namd $HOME/day-1-files/namd/step4_equilibration.inp (specify the input file)

#the $HOME directory tipically look like (/users/PGS0299/hasanur069, so if we use the $HOME it means the samepath. you can check the dirctory by run echo $HOME)


#then submit the job to the OSC supercomputer by running the following command
sbatch step4.sub


commands:
file extracts - tar vxzf [filename]
file size - ls -lh *.dcd

#we do not have to mention the ouput file directory where the
#output file will generate. it'll generate the file in the current directory

#watch the mds file
squeue -u hasanur069

#output file
go to the parent directory the look for the .dcd file (trajectory file [binary file]). 
If the .dcd file not exists then there have some error.

.xst is for analysis

equilibration.inp 
dcdfreq = the femtosec, picosec and nanosec

str = special parameters in there.

na = nucleic acid
carb = carbohydrate

dont calculate the atomic energy of the 1st 4th atoms.


how do i convert the steps to femtosec or nanosec?

the molecular dynamics simulaiton generate temprature when it starts

differnt steps, components, temperaturess.
